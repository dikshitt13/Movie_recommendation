# Movie_recommendation_system
In this project, I have utilized a machine learning algorithm to recommend a list of similar movies based on recent viewing history. The recommendations are generated by analyzing the genre and tags of the movies, and the machine learning model helps to identify and suggest movies that align with the userâ€™s preferences.
